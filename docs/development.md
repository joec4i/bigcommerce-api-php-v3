# BigCommerce API V3 Client Library

## Development

This PHP package is automatically generated by the
[Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project,
using the YAML files in the `swagger` directory. Follow the steps below
to set up and run the build process.

0. Prerequisites: docker

1. Run the generator script.
```
$ ./codegen.sh
```

## Cleaning up

Files created by the generator are stored under `.swagger-codegen` which should be cleaned up automatically. If 
`codegen.sh` fails, however, you will have to remove the directory manually.
